# Simple WordPress Guest Authors for Theme Developers
Simple plugin for WordPress which adds backend support for guest authors. 

## How it works
This plugin creates two meta fields in WordPress 'post' types: `dev_guest_author_img` and `dev_guest_author_name`. 

These two meta fields are accessible and editable in the Gutenberg editor through the document settings sidebar, where they will appear under the "Guest Authors" tab. 

The intent is for developers to take advantage of this plugin for the WordPress backend and then to simply access the two meta fields in their custom PHP templates.
